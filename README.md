# note-taker

For this project, I built off of given starter code to create a note taker application. To build this note-taker, I needed to install the dependencies in my package.json, including express.  I created a server.js file for my use, get, post and delete statements. I also utilized fs and path to support the functionality of the note-taker.  Finally, I needed to research npm packages to create unique ids for the notes.  I chose to use uuid and installed/utilized it in my server.js code.  

This note-taker allows the user to create new notes, with a title and text content, and save it to a list of saved notes.  These saved notes can be reopened by click on them, edited and saved by clicking the save button, and even deleted by clicking the trash button. If they use the wrong path, the user will be redirected to the start page where they can reclick the button to enter the note-taker app.
